# FindingTriangles

The coordinates are six integers;
The file with coordinates and the final file are indicated by arguments at start;
Enter the coordinates in the file through ';' or '', or use both options;
In case of incorrectly entered data, the program will let you know about it by a message to the console;
If the line contains more than six coordinates - it will not be taken into calculations;
If the line contains less than six coordinates, the missing ones will be replaced by zeros;
If some of the lines are correctly formatted, and some are not, the program will work with the correct lines.

Correct:

2; 3; 5; 8; 10; 6;

12 34 56 22 15 38

-1;-1;10;-1;-1;10;

Wrong:

1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

2,7,5,9,1,7
